    "### Overview\n",
    "This _guide_ using the API to lead you through a simple fastaq processing analysis which parallels the GUI _Quickstart featuring open-access data_ using the CGC <sup>1</sup>. We have written this example in Python, but the concepts can be adapted to your preferred programming language. We encourage you to try this analysis yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of the CGC is from the *user* who owns or is a member of multiple *projects*. Each *project* contains multiple *files* and *apps*. Users can run *tasks* by selecting input *files* and *configuration parameters* for an *app* within thier project. \n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
