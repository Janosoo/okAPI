    "# How do I find<sup>2</sup> & download TCGA data hosted on AWS?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The **goal** of this tutorial is to empower the public to access [TCGA](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+Home) data via [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## TCGA Data Types\n",
    "There are two [types](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/Open+Access+and+Controlled+Access+Data) of TCGA data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Open Access Data\n",
    " * Controlled Access Data \n",
    "\n",
    "Investigators can obtain access to _Controlled_ data through the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/) via the [dBGaP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) site. Seven Bridges has obtained _Trusted Partner_ status with the NIH and authenticates user through the Federated Identity service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to data access\n",
    "Finding and downloading TCGA data are accomplished with three different steps. Data is _found_ by constructing and executing a [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) query within the _Datasets API_ (Step 2). Data can be _downloaded_ by an API call (Step 3) if the user has appropriate access to the data type (Step 1). \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Register on the [Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/login/) (CGC)\n",
    " 2. [Dataset API](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/datasets-api-overview) to query a [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) database of hosted TCGA data. \n",
    " 3. The CGC [API](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/the-cgc-api) to download files\n",
    " \n",
    "We will follow these steps to find and then download _Open Access Data_ which will be accessible to **all users**. However, we _encourage users_ to modify the example query to stratify particularly interesting cohorts or obtain _Controlled Access Data_ (if they have the appropriate permission).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    " * This tutorial is written in **Python 2.7**, for compatibility with Python 3 please swap out the _urllib_ library. \n",
    " * Datasets API is an **Advanced Access** feature, which means, while it is fully operational, it is subject to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>2</sup> This is the **Datasets API** flavor of this tutorial. There is also an _OpenSPARQL_ version [here](access_TCGA_on_AWS.ipynb)"
