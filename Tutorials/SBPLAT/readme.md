# COMING SOON
We are happy to share a few _use-cases_  that have been useful for our customers. We are even happier to hear your **needs** so we can make things run more smoothly for you. 

These scripts have been hard-coded in a few places for the particular _workflow_ used. However, they are _extensively commented_ so they can be easily adapted to other tasks.

## How do I get started with RNA-seq?
The [**quickstartOpenData.ipynb**] tutorial creates an **open-data** project, add reference files and reference apps, create a task, and finally download the outputs. 

## defs/apimethods.py
Common functions and objects for all of the files. Note, this will **eventually** be replaced by _new_, _cleaner_ Python wrapper. However, any code developed with this apimethods.py wrapper will **remain functional**.

### Notes
1. _Extensive_ and _beautiful_ API documentation for the Seven Bridges Platform is available [here](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api)
