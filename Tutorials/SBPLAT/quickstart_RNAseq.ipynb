    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need an account on the Seven Bridges Platform ([sign up](https://www.sbgenomics.com/login) here for free).\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Imports and Definitions\n",
    "We will use a Python class (API) as a wrapper for API calls. All classes and methods defined in <a href=\"defs/apimethods.py\" target=\"_blank\">_defs/apimethods.py_</a>. "
