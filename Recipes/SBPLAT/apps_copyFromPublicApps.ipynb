    "# How do I _copy_ an app from the _public apps_?\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Apps can be copied from one of two sources:\n",
    "1. other projects you are a member of\n",
    "2. public reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we focus on copying an app from _public reference_. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least **one**_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 4. You understand how to <a href=\"apps_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> apps within your project (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " \n",
    "### Imports and Definitions\n",
    "A single call is sufficient to copy an app. Here there is **no advantage** in using the object to POST the call, but it is rather useful searching the results of the GET calls."

    "We will first list all our projects, then list the apps within the Public Reference project<sup>1</sup> , and finally copy an app between the Public Reference to the target project. Here we also explicitly set _'limit':100_ inside the _query_. This helps speed up the auto-pagination feature within the object constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical information for this POST is the **app_id**. Note, you are **not** allowed to copy the same app **and** assign the same name more than once. If you change the name, it is ok.\n",

    "To make these results very obvious, use an empty project as your TARGET\\_PROJECT (e.g. your <a href=projects_makeNew.ipynb> cookbook example project</a>) or change the _name_ in the _data_ dictionary to something like 'Dept of Awesome'<sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
