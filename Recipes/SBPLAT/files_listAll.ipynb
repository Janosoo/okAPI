    "Here we focus on listing all files within a single project. Importantly, files are only accessible **within** a project<sup>1</sup>. As with any **list**-type call, we will get minimal information about each file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 4. Your project needs to have at least one file inside\n",

    "## Imports\n",
    "We import the _Api_ class from the official sevenbridges-python bindings below.\n",
