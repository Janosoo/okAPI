    "### Overview\n",
    "Here we focus on listing all files within a single project. Importantly, files are only accessible **within** a project<sup>1</sup>. As with any **list**-type call, we will get minimal information about each file. We will show two options (A & B) of getting the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 4. Your project needs to have at least one file inside\n",
    " \n",
    "### Imports and Definitions\n",
    " A single call is sufficient to get a file list. We will show two different options, both of which are defined in the apimethods.py file.\n",
    " \n",
    " <sup>1</sup> There is no \"list **all** *files*\" API call that parallels the \"list **all**\" calls for *projects* and *apps*"
