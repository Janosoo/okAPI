    "# How do I _create_ and _start_ a task?\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "We are getting into advanced techniques here and will need to leverage a few other cookbooks. You will need to add an app and some files in your project, then it is easy to start one. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 4. You understand how to <a href=\"apps_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> apps within one of your projects (we will just use that call directly here). This is a **great place** to get the **app_id** you will need in this recipe.\n",
    " 5. You have at least one app in your project, maybe from <a href=\"apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">copying one</a>\n",
    " 6. You may want to review how to <a href=\"apps_detailOne.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\"> get details </a> of your app (we will assume you do, and pass the appropriate inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### WARNING\n",
    "This will burn through some processing credits (**about \\$0.50**). You can create _DRAFT_ tasks to just see how it works, swap the commenting in **Build and run tasks** to only run: \n",
