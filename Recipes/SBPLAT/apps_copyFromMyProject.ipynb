    "# How do I _copy_ an app from one of my other _projects_?\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Apps include both tools (individual bioinformatics utilities) and workflows (chains or pipelines of connected tools). Apps are located in one of two places: the [Seven Bridges Public Apps repository](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/apps) or a user-created project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "You can copy an app from the Public App repository or from a project of which you're a member. Here, we focus on **copying an app from another project**. [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/copy-an-app)]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "1. We'll list all our projects.\n",
    "2. Then, we'll list the apps within the first project on the list generated above. \n",
    "3. Lastly, we'll copy an app from the first project to the second project in our list of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of at least one project. Learn more about creating a new project. [[recipe](projects_makeNew.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-project)].\n",
    " 2. You need your **authentication token** and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">Setup_API_environment.ipynb</a> for details. Learn more about [obtaining your authentication token](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-your-authentication-token).\n",
    " 3. You understand how to list projects of which you are a member. We will use this call directly to select a project below. [[recipe](projects_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-your-projects)]\n",
    " 4. You have at least one app in your selected project. If not, you can copy one from the Public Apps repository. [[recipe](apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/copy-an-app)]\n",
    " 5. You understand how to list apps within a project. We will use this call below and select an app. [[recipe](apps_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-apps-available-to-you)]\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that as with all okAPI recipes, this recipe makes use of the [Seven Bridges Public API Python library](../Tutorials/SBPLAT/Setup_API_environment.ipynb)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "We import the `Api` class from the official `sevenbridges-python` bindings below."

    "## Copy an app you can access\n",
    "First, we'll list all our projects. Then, we'll list the apps within the first project. Lastly, we'll copy an app from the first project to the second project.

If you change the name, it is ok. Here we are using the App's **ID**, alternatively you can match bases on the App's **name** as shown here [apps_copyFromPublicApps](apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these results very obvious, use an empty project as your my\\_project (e.g. your <a href=projects_makeNew.ipynb> cookbook example project</a>) or add the _name_ arguement to something ridiculous like 'Orange Mocha Frapachino Maker'<sup>2</sup>\n",

    "\n",
    "<sup>2</sup> Note that setting the **name** of an app, actually changes the **id**. This will be fixed sometime in the future."
