    "### Overview\n",
    "There are a number of API calls related to projects. Here we focus on _creating a **new**_ project. Along the way, we will also show how to [list billing groups](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/list-your-billing-groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    "  3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly here).\n",

    "## Imports\n",
