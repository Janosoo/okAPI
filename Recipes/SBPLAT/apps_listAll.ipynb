    "### Overview\n",
    "Here we focus on listing all apps within a single project. As with any **list**-type call, we will get minimal information about each apps. There are two versions of this call:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. (default) **paginated** call that will return 50 apps\n",
    " 2. **all-records** call that will page through and return all apps .\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, we can also query all available apps (in all our projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 4. You have at least one app in your project, maybe from <a href=\"apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">copying one</a>\n",
