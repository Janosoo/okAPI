    "### Overview\n",
    "This recipe is actually an _edge-case_, but one that the author uses frequently. It would also be a good fit for someone using code from a github repo, e.g. [Gaurav Kaushik's](https://github.com/gaurav-kaushik) excellent ones. We will:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. create a new project\n",
    " 2. check that there are no apps\n",
    " 3. upload our app\n",
    " 4. check that it exists\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 2. You have a **properly formatted** JSON file<sup>1</sup>.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 4. You have at least one app in your project - one way to do this is by <a href=\"apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">copying</a> one\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup> Note: Using _select all_; _copy_; _paste to text editor_; _save as JSON_ can fail due to slight inconsistencies in how the OS handles formatting. A much better approach is either (i) download a properly formatted JSON or (ii) use the _export_ button on the desired app on the Seven Bridges Platform and save the resulting webpage as a JSON directly. \n",
