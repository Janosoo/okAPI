    "# What are the details of one of my _apps_?\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Obtaining a single app's details is an important step for starting a task. The app, which can be either a tool or a workflow, should be one located in a project that you can access. This could be an app that has been uploaded to the Seven Bridges Platform by a project member, or a publicly available app that has been copied to the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with any **detail**-type call, we will get extensive information about one app. However, we must first obtain that app's id. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this recipe we focus on **getting the details** from a single app. [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-details-of-an-app)]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "1. We'll list all our projects. [[recipe](projects_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-your-projects)]\n",
    "2. Then, we'll list the apps within the first project on the list generated above. [[recipe](apps_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-apps-available-to-you)]\n",
    "3. Lastly, we'll get the details for the first app in that project. [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-details-of-an-app)]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of at least one project. Learn more about creating a new project. [[recipe](projects_makeNew.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-project)].\n",
    " 2. You need your **authentication token** and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">Setup_API_environment.ipynb</a> for details. Learn more about [obtaining your authentication token](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-your-authentication-token).\n",
    " 3. You understand how to list projects of which you are a member. We will use this call directly to select a project below. [[recipe](projects_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-your-projects)]\n",
    " 4. You have at least one app in your selected project. If not, you can copy one from the Public Apps repository. [[recipe](apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/copy-an-app)]\n",
    " 5. You understand how to list apps within a project. We will use this call below and select an app. Note that this is a great place to get the **app_id** you will need in this recipe. [[recipe](apps_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-apps-available-to-you)]\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that as with all okAPI recipes, this recipe makes use of the [Seven Bridges Public API Python library](../Tutorials/SBPLAT/Setup_API_environment.ipynb).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "We import the `Api` class from the official `sevenbridges-python` bindings below."
