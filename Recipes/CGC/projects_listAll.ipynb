    "There are a number of API calls related to projects. Here we focus on listing them. As with any **list**-type call, we will get minimal information about each project. We will show two options (A & B) of getting the same information.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
