    "# How do I make a new _project_?\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "There are a number of API calls related to projects. Here we focus on _creating a **new**_ project.  We will show two options (A & B) of doing the same thing. Along the way, we will also show how to [list billing groups](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/list-your-billing-groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 2. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly here to prevent remaking the same project twice).\n",
    " \n",
    "### Imports and Definitions\n",
    "A single call is sufficient post a NewProject JSON and create a project. We will show two different options, both of which are defined in the apimethods.py file."
