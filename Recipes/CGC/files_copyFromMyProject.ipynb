    "# How do I _copy_ a file from another on of _my projects_?\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Files can be copied from one of two sources:\n",
    "1. other projects you are a member of\n",
    "2. public reference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we focus on copying a file from _your own project_. We will show two options (A & B) of achieving the same goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least **two**_ projects.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 4. You understand how to <a href=\"files_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> files within one of your projects (we will just use that call directly here).\n",
    " \n",
    "### Imports and Definitions\n",
    "A single call is sufficient to get a file list. We will show two different options, both of which are defined in the apimethods.py file. Here there is **no advantage** in using the object to POST the call.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Warning\n",
    "You are only permitted to copy a TCGA-protected file to a _target project_ if that project also has TCGA-protected permissions."
