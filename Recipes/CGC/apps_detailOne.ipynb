    "### Overview\n",
    "Here we focus on _getting the details_ from a single app. This will be important later when we want to start a task. As with any **detail**-type call, we will get extensive information about one app but must first know that app's id. We will show two options (A & B) of getting the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb\">**set_AUTH_TOKEN.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly here).\n",
    " 4. You understand how to <a href=\"apps_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> apps within one of your projects (we will just use that call directly here).\n",
    " 5. You have added (or  <a href=\"apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">copied</a>) least one app file in your project\n",

    "### Imports and Definitions\n",
