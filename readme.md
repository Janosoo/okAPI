# ok, API     
### Advanced Access Program [advanced\_access branch]
To help people maximize the _extensibility_ and _automation_ capability of our products, we're happy to share example **API** code. These examples have been used to address common user _wants_ and _needs_. They are divided into **recipes** & **tutorials**. 

* **_"How do I do this one thing?"_** You want a **recipe**, which is a _modular_ example of common operations. 
* **_"How do I complete my entire analysis?"_** You want a **tutorial**, which may _combine multiple recipes_ to go from start to finish of an analysis. 

The _recipe_ and _tutorial_ folders are subdivided into **CGC** (Cancer Genomics Cloud) and **SBPLAT** (Seven Bridges Platform). This separation ensures we link to the appropriate docs. Each folder has it's own _readme_ files within each folder which details the scripts. Feedback and improvements are welcome. Good luck & have fun!

## Branches
Note there are two branches of this repository. You are on the **advanced\_access** branch.

* **advanced\_access**: This was developed from January to May 2016 and uses _apimethods.py_. This is an **unofficial** branch where we may roll out new features. It is _only compatible_ with Python 2.7.
* **master**: This was released April 2016 and uses _sevenbridges-python_, the **official** Python bindings supported by Seven Bridges. This branch includes most of the API functionality and is compatible with Python 2.6+ and 3.

### Notes
1. This is compatible with **Python 2.7 only**. For Python 3 compatiblity, please go to the _main_ branch.
2. This is an **beta** and we are constantly working on improving our examples. Expect the awesomeness to continue.
3. Please share your _feedback_ on our [CGC forum](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/discuss) or [SBG forum](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/discuss).
4. We are happy to recieve Pull Requests with your _improvements_.
